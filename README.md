# Contact Management REST API with Spring Boot

This is a RESTful API built using **Spring Boot** that provides functionality for user authentication, contact management, and address management.  
The project follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern** and uses **Spring Data JPA** for database interactions.

Developed as part of my learning experience from the **Udemy course "Spring Boot: Pemula sampai Mahir"** by **Programmer Zaman Now**.

## Features
- **User Management**: Register, login, update profile, and logout.
- **Contact Management**: Create, update, retrieve, delete, and search contacts.
- **Address Management**: Associate addresses with contacts, manage multiple addresses.

## Tech Stack & Dependencies
This project uses the following technologies:
- **Spring Boot** (Backend framework)
- **Spring Web MVC** (REST API)
- **Spring Data JPA** (Database interaction)
- **MySQL** (Relational database)
- **Validation** (Input validation)
- **Lombok** (Boilerplate code reduction)

## What I Learned from Spring Boot
This project helped me understand key Spring Boot concepts, including:
1. **MVC Design Pattern** - Implementing clean architecture using Model-View-Controller.
2. **Dependency Injection (DI)** - Managing dependencies efficiently with Springâ€™s IoC container.
3. **Spring Data JPA** - Simplifying database operations using JPA and repositories.
4. **Spring Boot Annotations** - Understanding core annotations like `@RestController`, `@Service`, and `@Repository`.
5. **Validation & Exception Handling** - Using `@Valid` and `@ExceptionHandler` to ensure robust input handling.
6. **Environment Configuration** - Managing application properties with `application.yml` for different environments.
7. **Token-Based Authentication** - Securing APIs using authentication mechanisms.
8. **REST API Best Practices** - Designing well-structured and scalable API endpoints.
